## What I learned- 

- API Integration: Through building the dictionary website, I gained hands-on experience in integrating APIs into my JavaScript code. I learned how to send requests to external API endpoints and receive data in a format like JSON.

- Fetching Data: I learned how to use JavaScript's fetch API to retrieve data from the integrated API. By making asynchronous requests, I was able to fetch definitions, translations, or other relevant information from the dictionary API and display it on my website.

- Handling API Responses: I learned how to handle API responses effectively. This involved parsing and extracting the necessary data from the API response, handling error scenarios, and dynamically updating the website's content based on the retrieved data.
